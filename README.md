# ALERT
All this code is very experimental, not even close to having a release, has flaws all over. WIP

# sure-indicator
Different ways to get support and resistance (horizontal) price zones in market data dataframes.

# How?

In this approach we are dealing with little information about 1000 tikers.
At first I do not expect good results from this but it is interesting to try.

Currently there is one OHCL approach with a sklearn lib MeanShift clustering which is fast
and it could be fine tunned to obtain better results.

# Current plots

This are current plots, which are not very usefull. Based on not very tunned settings, only 999 tickers of data.
